# Fabrik Element Survey

<p>Survey Plugin is an Element plugin, through the use of this plugin it is possible to create a poll element for voting where you can configure several alternatives.</p>

<p>Example: </p>
<ul>
    <li> 
        Element Stuck with options to vote: Cheap | Dear | Very expensive
    </li>
    <li>
        Quality Element with options to vote: Bad | Regular | Good | Great
    </li>
</ul>
